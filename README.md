###Phases
There are three phases to the paradigm. They are:

1. ssVEP
2. ERP
3. ssVEP

Each phase gets 4/12 unique faces per species randomly assigned. 

###ssVEP
* The two ssVEP phases are idential except for the faces we show in each one
* There are 10 trials that each last 10 seconds (do 20 trials total: twice per species)
* 5.88 faces presented per second
* 4 standard faces then 1 oddball
* Sinusoidal modulation of transparancy
* No consecutive oddballs are the same
* varying image size by 10%
